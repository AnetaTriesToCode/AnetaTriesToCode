### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aneta and I'm at the very beginning of my coding career as a student at CoGrammar, Full stack web development cohort. In this profile you can find multiple repositories with my projects, such as:
- **my CV in HTML**
- **periodic table as an exercise of responsive design**
- **various CSS stylesheets**
- **Javascript fortune telling <sub>(because I'm 6)</sub> and water bill calculator <sub>(because I'm 60)</sub>**
- **Functional programming**
- **Object orientated programming**

Those can be found in my following repository: https://github.com/AnetaTriesToCode/Web-Dev-fundamentals , which I hope will be only getting more and more content as my experience broadens.

In my profile you can also find repositories relating to my T05 build your brand task.
